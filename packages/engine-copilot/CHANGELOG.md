# @holdpoint/engine-copilot

## 0.1.0-alpha.11

### Patch Changes

- Install holdpoint as a devDependency during init; hooks use node_modules/.bin

  holdpoint init now runs `npm/pnpm/yarn install --save-dev holdpoint@alpha` after
  writing all config files, using the detected package manager. This pins the
  version in package.json and makes node_modules/.bin/holdpoint available so hooks
  resolve locally without downloading on every fire.

  All engine defaults change from `npx holdpoint@alpha check --staged` to
  `node_modules/.bin/holdpoint check --staged`. The engines.\*.stop_command /
  engines.copilot.check_command override still works as before.

  Templates updated: holdpoint-evolve uses `node_modules/.bin/holdpoint evolve`
  instead of `npx @holdpoint/cli@alpha evolve`.

  MASTER_PROMPT.md updated: all `npx @holdpoint/cli@alpha` references → `holdpoint`
  (short command, available via devDep after npm install).

## 0.1.0-alpha.10

### Patch Changes

- Copilot engine: extension-only — remove shell hooks entirely

  The extension now handles both responsibilities in one file:
  - onSessionStart: reads checks.immutable.json (pre-parsed JSON — no YAML parser
    needed in plain .mjs) and injects session_context_files as additionalContext
  - onPreToolUse: intercepts task_complete, delegates to holdpoint CLI for checks

  The shell hooks system (.github/hooks/holdpoint.json + holdpoint-check.mjs) is
  removed. It existed because session context injection predated the extension, not
  because it was the right mechanism. The SDK extension is deterministic, runs as a
  persistent process over JSON-RPC, and handles both jobs cleanly.

  Copilot agent detection now looks for extension.mjs instead of holdpoint.json.

## 0.1.0-alpha.9

### Patch Changes

- Rewrite Copilot extension to delegate to the CLI instead of inlining check logic

  The generated extension.mjs shrank from 329 lines to 39. Instead of duplicating
  matchesWhen(), runCheck(), commit cache, staged-file detection, and auto-sync logic,
  the extension now shells out to `npx holdpoint@alpha check --staged` (or the
  configured engines.copilot.check_command override). The engine-when-sync check in
  checks.yaml is removed — it existed only to keep the two copies in sync.

  Adds engines.copilot.check_command to the checks.yaml schema, consistent with the
  engines.claude.stop_command and engines.codex.stop_command added previously.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @holdpoint/types@0.1.0-alpha.5

## 0.1.0-alpha.7

### Patch Changes

- Fix workspace:\* protocol leaking into published npm packages

  All packages were published via `npm publish` which does not convert pnpm's
  `workspace:*` dependency protocol to real version numbers. Switched CI to
  `pnpm publish --no-git-checks` which performs this conversion automatically.
  All packages need a version bump so clean tarballs can be published to npm.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6

### Patch Changes

- Remove dead task_complete gating code from generated holdpoint-check.mjs

  The Copilot hooks script (.github/hooks/holdpoint-check.mjs) was carrying ~280 lines of check-running logic that was never reachable — holdpoint.json only registers it for sessionStart events, and task_complete interception is handled exclusively by extension.mjs via the Copilot SDK. The script is now sessionStart-only (62 lines vs 344).

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- fix: version consistency, PostToolUse noise, git-commit stdout, unknown-stack conditions, turbo cache
  - Unified all generated hook commands to `holdpoint@alpha` (was a mix of `@latest`, `@alpha`, and no tag)
  - Removed PostToolUse hook from engine-claude — it fired on every tool call with `||true`, blocking nothing; Stop hook is sufficient
  - Fixed git-commit check printing `true` to stdout: `2>/dev/null` → `>/dev/null 2>&1`
  - Gated `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` in `_base.yaml` behind an `is_node` condition (file_exists: package.json) so unknown-stack repos don't see confusing pnpm failures
  - Added explanatory comment to generated `holdpoint.json` when hooks is empty (extension.mjs handles task_complete interception)
  - Improved "no changed files" hint to tell new users to commit generated files
  - Added `../../templates/**` to turbo inputs for `@holdpoint/cli#build` so template edits invalidate the cache correctly
  - Removed pnpm-specific `.npmrc` keys (`auto-install-peers`, `shamefully-hoist`, `strict-peer-dependencies`) that caused npm warnings in the Stop hook

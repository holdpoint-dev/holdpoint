## 0.1.0-alpha.12

### Patch Changes

- 8d24ea1: release: single-track publishing — drop the `alpha` dist-tag, use `latest` only

  We're a solo-maintained pre-1.0 project with no parallel release tracks
  (no LTS, no beta, no stable-being-patched-while-experiments-ship). Two
  dist-tags (`latest` + `alpha`) only bought us complexity: every release
  required either a workflow that synced both (which silently broke under
  OIDC trusted publishing, since OIDC tokens don't authorize subsequent
  `npm dist-tag add` calls) or manual repair commands after each publish.

  This bump moves everyone to single-track `latest`-only publishing:
  - `publishConfig.tag` removed from all 11 package.json files (npm
    defaults to `latest` when unset).
  - `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` was already simplified to publish
    with `--tag latest` only; the dist-tag sync block is gone.
  - `scripts/publish.sh` (local manual publish) drops the dist-tag sync.
  - `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, README, web app, and CLI install
    instructions now use `npx holdpoint` (no `@alpha` suffix).
  - The historical `alpha` dist-tag on npm is left pointing at the last
    alpha-tagged version (`0.1.0-alpha.16`) as a breadcrumb; remove
    manually with `npm dist-tag rm @holdpoint/<pkg> alpha` if desired.

  The version-string format stays `0.1.0-alpha.N` (we remain in
  `.changeset/pre.json` pre-release mode). "Alpha" is signaled by the
  version string, the README banner, and the alpha-software callouts —
  not by the dist-tag, which is just a default-resolver.

## 0.1.0-alpha.11

### Patch Changes

- 42a9a4f: agent-context: breadcrumbs in standardized files + verified injection + Cursor promoted
  - New: init and update splice a "Holdpoint workflow" breadcrumb
    into each agent's standardized instructions file (CLAUDE.md,
    .github/copilot-instructions.md, .cursor/rules/holdpoint.md,
    AGENTS.md). Marker-based; preserves user content outside the
    block; idempotent. Gives discoverability and lets agents that
    read these files natively pick up the rule without depending
    on the session-start hook.
  - Split: MASTER_PROMPT.md is now ~50 imperative lines (always
    injected at session start, fits comfortably within engine
    truncation caps). The previous 341-line reference content
    moved to HOLDPOINT_REFERENCE.md, on disk for on-demand reads.
  - New tests: each engine has a context-injection test that runs
    the SessionStart script with a fixture repo and asserts the
    critical "Run holdpoint check" sentence survives truncation.
    Prevents the silent regression where a long MASTER_PROMPT
    pushed the rule past the cap.
  - Removed: stale "Cursor advisory" framing from README, init
    preflight, and docs. Cursor uses .cursor/hooks.json hook
    surface (sessionStart, preToolUse, stop, etc.) for full hard
    gating — same enforcement class as Claude and Copilot.

- 93230de: cursor: install native project hooks for runtime enforcement

  Cursor now receives `.cursor/hooks.json` and `.cursor/holdpoint-hook.mjs` in addition to the contextual `.cursorrules` block. The hooks inject configured session context, stream Cursor lifecycle/tool events into Holdpoint Live, and run Holdpoint checks on local `stop` / completed `subagentStop` events with automatic follow-up messages when checks fail.

- ab18bdf: cursor: keep `.cursorrules` updates idempotent

  Regenerating Holdpoint engine files no longer accumulates blank lines before the generated `.cursorrules` block.

## 0.1.0-alpha.10

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @holdpoint/types@0.1.0-alpha.7

## 0.1.0-alpha.9

### Patch Changes

- Install holdpoint as a devDependency during init; hooks use node_modules/.bin

  holdpoint init now runs `npm/pnpm/yarn install --save-dev holdpoint@alpha` after
  writing all config files, using the detected package manager. This pins the
  version in package.json and makes node_modules/.bin/holdpoint available so hooks
  resolve locally without downloading on every fire.

  All engine defaults change from `npx holdpoint@alpha check --staged` to
  `node_modules/.bin/holdpoint check --staged`. The engines.\*.stop_command /
  engines.copilot.check_command override still works as before.

  Templates updated: holdpoint-evolve uses `node_modules/.bin/holdpoint evolve`
  instead of `npx @holdpoint/cli@alpha evolve`.

  MASTER_PROMPT.md updated: all `npx @holdpoint/cli@alpha` references → `holdpoint`
  (short command, available via devDep after npm install).

## 0.1.0-alpha.6

### Patch Changes

- Fix workspace:\* protocol leaking into published npm packages

  All packages were published via `npm publish` which does not convert pnpm's
  `workspace:*` dependency protocol to real version numbers. Switched CI to
  `pnpm publish --no-git-checks` which performs this conversion automatically.
  All packages need a version bump so clean tarballs can be published to npm.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- fix: version consistency, PostToolUse noise, git-commit stdout, unknown-stack conditions, turbo cache
  - Unified all generated hook commands to `holdpoint@alpha` (was a mix of `@latest`, `@alpha`, and no tag)
  - Removed PostToolUse hook from engine-claude — it fired on every tool call with `||true`, blocking nothing; Stop hook is sufficient
  - Fixed git-commit check printing `true` to stdout: `2>/dev/null` → `>/dev/null 2>&1`
  - Gated `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` in `_base.yaml` behind an `is_node` condition (file_exists: package.json) so unknown-stack repos don't see confusing pnpm failures
  - Added explanatory comment to generated `holdpoint.json` when hooks is empty (extension.mjs handles task_complete interception)
  - Improved "no changed files" hint to tell new users to commit generated files
  - Added `../../templates/**` to turbo inputs for `@holdpoint/cli#build` so template edits invalidate the cache correctly
  - Removed pnpm-specific `.npmrc` keys (`auto-install-peers`, `shamefully-hoist`, `strict-peer-dependencies`) that caused npm warnings in the Stop hook
